DOCUMENTATION LAYOUT    V 2.0
=============================



I added two multiplexer to switch between 7 and 14 MHz. This was necessary
because some software had problems at 14 MHz (e.g. Janus.library). The
multiplexers I use has four channels with each two inputs and one output.
Five signals (\VMA, \VPA, E-CLK, \DTACK and CLK) must be switched.
So we need two multiplexers.

The multiplexer MUST! be a fast (F) type, otherwise the gate delay is
be too long.

Here's how I connected it :

The SEL is now synconized with 7 MHz so that you simply can switch between
7 and 14 MHz without \HALT (this was in the last release) while the Amiga
is running and it shouldn't crash.
This is done with a D-flipflop 74F74 (also fast (F) type!) :

|           Switch                                           |
|  +5V      input    7 MHz     +5V      SEL            Ground|

     1        2        3        4        5        6       7


(Switch input is +5V or Ground)
(SEL is select output used by the 74F157 as input)



The next thing I added is a jumper (J1). This will vary the way \DTACK is
syncronized. The middle must be connected with the left OR the right side.
(74LS27/2 is connected with 74LS74/9 or with \DTACK - some machines only
work one way ... because it's an Amiga !)

To smooth the flanks I added eight (C3-C10) capacitors (100nF).



REBUILDING :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's double sided. The lower side is the reflected image.
I made a hardcopy and it looks well. For better results use a 2:1 scale if
you can.
There's only one through-connect (between the 74F157 and 74LS112).

Amiga 500 owner should not plug the MC 68000 in a socket (it's to high), but
they will need a 64 pin socket as a distance to the ROM.

The accelerator plugs by two 32 pin strips in the CPU-socket.


Parts you need besides :

- 2x 74 F 157
- 1x 74 F 74
- 1x 74 F 86 (replace for 74 LS 86)
- 8x 100nF
- 2x 22pF
- 2x 560 Ohm
- 1x 10KOhm
- 1x 64 pin socket
- 2x 32 pin strips
- 1x single switch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wanting to know the acceleration precise I wrote a CPU performance test
program (See performance directory). Look at my tests and things come clear.


Special thanks to Livio Plos for his great and cheap Amiga accelerator.
Thanks Livio !

Any critiques, suggestions, questions, etc. are welcome !
