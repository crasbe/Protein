I wrote this program to test the speed increase of CPU operations by a 14 MHz
68000 accelerator. The speed tests run a loop of about 200.000 times the
same command (source and (if necessary) destination are data registers) and
disables multitasking by doing this.
Only MC68000/10 are detected. MC68020/30/40 and Kickstart 2.0 are NOT
supported (a guru maybe possible !) !

If you have 16 bit fastram cmp, clr, not and neg will be +10%.

Please email me results of 68000/10 7/14 MHz accelerator boards (e.g.
AdSpeed). Thanks.
