*** Source file is protein_1_ide.tt4 . Device is M4A5-64/32-10JC .

<Note>  F40016:  0 pins have been reserved out of 34 .
<Note>  F40021:  34 pins are available after reservation, 32 are required
                 by the design.
<Note> Node irq_synch0 := ide_irq as Input Register.
<Note>  F35065:  For outputs, implicit output enables will be set to VCC.
<Note>  F35068:  Since SET/RESET DON'T CARE is turned off, any unspecified
                 SET/RESET will be defaulted to GND.
